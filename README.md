# Archive Menu

Archive Menu attempts a simple fix for the lack of easy archive extraction on Windows 11. Just associate your archive formats with it, and when double clicking an archive, a popup menu will show, allowing you to open or extract the contents, using 7zip.

If you have [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher) installed, the menu is skinned the same way the Win+X menu is skinned.

This is not a definite solution, but a workaround in the meantime until 7zip gets updated with Windows 11 context menu support or I take the time to learn how to do it myself.

To compile, place an `.ico` file in the folder where you cloned the project.

Precompiled binaries are available in [Releases](https://github.com/valinet/archivemenu/releases).
